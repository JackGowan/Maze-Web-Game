            You pull yourself from the underground pool and follow the dark tunnel toward the voices. The sound echoes strangely, making it hard to tell how far away they are.
            <p>As you get closer, you recognize the voices - guttural, harsh. Beast men. You slow down, moving cautiously.</p>
            <p>The tunnel opens into a chamber where you can see through iron bars into a prison area. You've found a back way into the same prison cells where prisoners are kept.</p>
            <p>Through the bars, you see a human figure huddled in the corner - a woman with long blonde hair. She looks up, hearing your footsteps, hope and fear mixing in her blue eyes.</p>
            <p>The path has led you to Alice, just via a different route. The key to her cell hangs on the wall, just within reach through the bars.</p>
