            You decide the statue is a distraction. The insect noises behind those doors are growing louder and more agitated. Best to keep moving.
            <p>You hurry past the glowing statue and down a narrow corridor. The light fades behind you as you descend deeper into the maze.</p>
            <p> Going carefully along the tunnels you patiently search out any traps, you journey along one corridor and then another. </p>

            <p>You go up a flight of stairs.</p>
