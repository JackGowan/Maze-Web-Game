        You unlock the iron door and push it open. A massive feasting hall lit by roaring fire pits.
        <p>At a long table sit ten fat old orcs. They look slow traveller - generations of gluttony and idleness make them weak. Four hundred pounds each, armor straining. They're gorging on roasted meat, bones cracking between their teeth.</p>
        <p>They haven't noticed you. Too absorbed in their feast, arguing over the choicest cuts, laughing with mouths full.</p>
        <p>Your enchanted sword gleams - you could take these fatties, attack while they're distracted. But... there's a side passage hidden by tapestries - you might sneak past.</p>
        <p>One orc starts to turn toward the door. Seconds to decide!</p>
