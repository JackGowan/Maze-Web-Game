        You wonder through the crystal caverns, searching. Crystalline formations glow with inner light, casting prismatic patterns. The air hums with magical power.
        <p> But something isn't quite right. Havent you been here before?</p>
        <p> There is a feeling that ahead is something dangerous and way above your level.</p>
        <p>Maybe you got it wrong perhaps there is another way to go.</p>
