        In a dark chamber you come across a silver sword. You take hold of it - the perfect weight, there seems to be a dim glow about it. There is no mistake, it is magical.
        <p>The maze has tested you. You want to see what lies at its heart.</p>
        <p>The corridor winds downward, glowing fungi providing eerie green light. Air grows warmer and humid. You pass old storage rooms, abandoned guard posts, evidence of ancient civilization.</p>
        <p> Blade in hand, you slowly make your way forward.</p>
