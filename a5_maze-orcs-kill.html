        You charge in with a battle cry. Your enchanted sword arcs through the air, striking the nearest orc before they can react.
        <p>Surprise is everything. The orcs are slow, bloated from years of excess. They scramble for weapons but you're already among them, your blade singing.</p>
        <p>One falls. Two. Three. Your sword cuts through armor and flesh with supernatural sharpness.</p>
        <p>Four. Five. Six. The remaining orcs panic, no longer attacking but fleeing. But they're too slow.</p>
        <p>Seven. Eight. Nine. The last orc drops to its knees, begging.</p>
        <p>Ten orcs lie dead. You're breathing hard, covered in sweat and blood, but victorious. The enchanted sword glows brighter, pleased with the battle.</p>
        <p>Beyond the feast hall, a narrow passage leads to natural caverns. You sense you're getting closer to something significant.</p>
