              The person in the cell is a young woman with long blonde hair, a skinny waist and large breasts. Her face streaked with dirt and tears. She looks up at you with desperate blue eyes.</p>
            <p>"Please!" she cries out, stumbling to her feet and gripping the bars. "Please help me! I've been trapped here for days! The key - it's hanging on the wall beside you!"</p>
            <p>You glance to your left - there it is, a rusty key hanging on a hook.
            <p>The woman's eyes plead with you. "Please! Don't leave me here to die!"</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">What do you do?!</p>
