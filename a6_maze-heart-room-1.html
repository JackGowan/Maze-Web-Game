        The chamber was cold with nearly the whole room covered by a pool of water. In the centre stood seven white pillars with a black platform raised around them. Heat came from flower like lamps at the centre.
        
        <p>In the waters, you see yourself. Every decision you made in the maze plays out in silvery images. The paths you chose. The dangers you faced.</p>     
        <p>At the far end it leads to another chamber.</p>
