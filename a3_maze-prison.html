            <p>You rush through a doorway into a small chamber. Your hands find a heavy wooden door and you slam it shut behind you. There's a thick iron bar mounted on the wall - you grab it and drop it into place across the door with a satisfying CLUNK.</p>
            <p>You spin around, raising your lantern. The chamber holds a prison cell. Iron bars divide the room. Behind them, huddled in the corner, a human is whimpering.
            <p>Then you look past the cell - there's another door on the far side of the chamber, beyond the prison bars, an escape route.</p>
          
           <p> Something tells you that there is something wrong with the far door. Choose wisely.</p>
