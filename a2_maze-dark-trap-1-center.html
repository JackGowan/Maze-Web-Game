            The center passage looks safe. Too safe. But maybe it really is the right choice?
            <p>You take three steps into the passage. Nothing happens. You take another step, feeling more confident.</p>
            <p>CLICK.</p>
            <p>A pressure plate. The walls begin to close in from both sides, grinding stone on stone. You try to run forward but there's no escape - the walls are too fast, the passage too long.</p>
            <p>You're crushed between ancient stone blocks, your bones cracking like kindling. Your last thought is that you should have known better.</p>
            <p style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">YOU HAVE DIED</p>
            <p>The obvious safe choice is often the deadliest trap.</p>
