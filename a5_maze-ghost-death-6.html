         You run in with your sword. 
        <p>The cavern goes black. Temperature drops fifty degrees. You can't move. Frozen in place.</p>
        <p>Greg's voice becomes terrible, ancient rage given sound: "YOU TRY TO HURT ME? YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND SINCE CURLY JEFFERSON, YOU WOULD DENY ME EVEN THE COURTESY OF COMPANIONSHIP!"</p>
        <p> You are unable to respond</p>
        <p>"ME AND YOU WERE GETTING SO CLOSE. SO I WILL TAKE WHAT I NEED."</p>
        <p>The darkness enters your mouth, eyes, ears. Greg consumes your memories, experiences, your very soul - feasting on your essence for entertainment.</p>
        <p style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">YOU HAVE DIED</p>
        <p>Never under any circumstances attack a demon lord</p>
