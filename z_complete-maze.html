        You walk through the tunnel of golden light, and with each step the maze falls away behind you. The walls, the chambers, the trials - all dissolving into radiance.
        <p>At the true center of the maze, you find yourself in a space that defies description. It's not a room, but a convergence - where all the paths meet, where all the lessons crystallize into understanding.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="color: #ffff00; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE MAZE</p>
        <br>
        <p>Whatever lies ahead, you carry those lessons with you. The maze is behind you. Your new journey begins now.</p>
        <p>But something tells you, that you have not seen the last of the maze master...</p>
