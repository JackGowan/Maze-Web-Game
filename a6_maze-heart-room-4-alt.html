        You reach for the crystal. The power calls to you. Imagine what you could do with such magic.
        <p>"No..." Alice whispers, her blue eyes filling with tears. "Please don't..."</p>
        <p>But you grasp the crystal anyway. Power floods through you - intoxicating, overwhelming, magnificent. You can feel reality bending to your will.</p>
        <p>Alice screams. She's dissolving, fading away. "You learned nothing!" she cries. "The maze tried to teach you that bonds matter more than power, but you chose yourself! You chose—"</p>
        <p>Her voice cuts off as she disappears completely.</p>
        <p>You're alone in the chamber. A door opens, leading to the outside world. You walk through, crystal in hand, power thrumming through your veins.</p>
        <p>But as you emerge into sunlight, you feel it. The crystal isn't giving you power. It's draining you. It was a curse disguised as a gift.</p>
        <p>You try to drop it but it's fused to your hand. Your life force pours into the crystal, feeding it, sustaining it. You fall to your knees as the curse takes hold.</p>
        <p style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">YOU HAVE FAILED</p>
        <p>You escaped the maze alive, but you failed its test. Power without companionship is just another prison. And you'll carry this curse forever, alone.</p>
