        <p>"Hi there" It says.</p>
        <p>"What's going on. What is this"</p>
        <p>"You, you, you've been asleep. You want a little drinky?"</p>
        <p>"Where am I? </p>
        <p>"Greg's place". The being whispers.</p>
        <p>Is this the end of the maze?"</p>
        <p>"A traveller with lots of question" The being beams "The delight of my life." </p>
        <p>You get up and start to look around. You are out of the crystal caverns and in a deeper section of the maze. A series of inner caves for sure but with lived in furniture and homely torches on the wall.
          You are making progress. You just need to get rid of this thing in front of you.</p>
        <p> Greg continues to stare at you expectantly and with intense curiosity.</p>
        <p>"I need to get going. Sorry but I've got a few things on". You state boldly</p>
        <p>"But why the rush?</p>
        <p>"I'm on an important mission"</p>  
         <p>"When are you free?"</p>
        <p> "I'm man about town. Got a few things on. I've got to get going."</p>
        <p>"Why not chat right now?" It would be awfully good of you stay and chat."</p>
        <p>"I'm a bit busy"</p>  
        <p>"Can't you tell me your story of how you learned of the maze and how you got here?"
        <p>You notice you are unarmed again. Careful traveller. You sense something about this being, that as pathetic as it looks. It is very, very, dangerous. Choose wisely.</p>` %>
