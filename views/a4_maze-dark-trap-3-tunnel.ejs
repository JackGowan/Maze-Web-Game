            <p>About twenty feet in, you realize what's making the scraping sounds. The tunnel is getting narrower. No - the walls are closing in, very slowly but steadily.</p>
            <p>You try to crawl faster but panic makes you clumsy. Your shoulders scrape against stone. The space gets tighter. Tighter.</p>
            <p>You're stuck. The walls continue their inexorable movement. You scream and struggle but there's nowhere to go, no way to move. The stone presses against your ribs.</p>
            <p>You can't breathe. The pressure becomes unbearable. Your bones crack. The tunnel crushes you slowly, methodically, like an ancient predator.</p>
            <p style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">YOU HAVE DIED</p>
