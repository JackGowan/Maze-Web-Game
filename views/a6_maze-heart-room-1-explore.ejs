        You wade through the water to the central platform.
        On the platform island you are struck by a life-like female doll wearing a silver tiara. Is that... Alice? You can't be sure. 
        You take your time to carefully explore the island.
        <p>The floor beneath is made of polished obsidian that reflects the ceiling above - a ceiling painted with constellations that slowly rotate, as if you're watching the night sky speed through time. The mirrors are not ordinary glass - they seem to be made of liquid silver that ripples when you approach. </p>
        <p>The air itself seems to hum with a gentle energy, encouraging contemplation and honest self-assessment. This is truly a chamber designed to make you see yourself clearly.</p>
