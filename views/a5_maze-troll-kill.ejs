        You charge forward, enchanted sword gleaming. The troll swings its club but you're faster. Your blade cuts deep.
        <p>The troll gasps in shock as you lob its head clean off. That will teach the little barstead to mess with you.</p>
        <p>You take the key hanging from the troll's necklace. Beyond, a massive iron door stands sealed. The key fits perfectly.</p>
        <p>Through the door - voices. Guttural, harsh voices. Many of them. The smell of cooking fires and unwashed bodies.</p>
