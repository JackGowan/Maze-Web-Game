            <p>"Thank you," she gasps. "I'm Alice. I was captured three days ago by the beast men who guard this maze."</p>
            <p>Alice's eyes are wide with fear, but there's something else there too - determination. "Thank you for saving me." She says again. "But the maze master won't be pleased if he finds out." </p>
            <p>"The Mase master is near?"</p>
            <p> Alice draws close to you. "He is near... In secret chambers below. He locked me in here due to my magical powers. We must get out of here."</p> 
            <p> "You're safe with me." You can see that she is capable of ancient magic.</p>  
            <p> You stare at her and she stares at you.</p>
            <p> "Let us escape from this place." Alice says at last.</p>
            <p> "No. I've come too far. I will go on. And you must help me. How do we find this maze master?" </p>
            <p> "The far door leads to a death trap. But..." She closes her eyes and whispers strange words. Her hands glow with faint blue light.</p>
            <p>The stone wall to your right shimmers and becomes transparent, revealing a hidden staircase descending into darkness.</p>
            <p>"I will be able to guide you some of the way." Alice says, her voice trembling. "This passage leads deeper into the maze, toward its heart. The beast men patrol these lower levels. We must be careful."</p>
            <p>She clutches your arm, her fingers trembling. "Please... don't let them find us. I can't go back in that cell."</p>
            <p> "I will be firm but fair. And protect you at all costs."</p>` %>
