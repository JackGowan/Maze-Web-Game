        <p>You walk across the bridge to the central monstrous column. </p>
        <p>A large tapestry catches your eye. A wide almost egg-shell like man stares at you with wise eyes. He holds his hands, patient. Across the walls are pictures of travellers layered over centuries. Warriors, scholars, common folk. </p>
        <p>In the center of the chamber stands a brazier that burns with steady white flame. </p>
        <p>High above, carved into the vaulted ceiling, are words in an ancient script.</p>
        <p>The chamber feels different now - not menacing, but empowering. This is a place that strengthens those who pass through it.</p>
