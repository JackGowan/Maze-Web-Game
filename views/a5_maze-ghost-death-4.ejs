        <p>The ghost's warm golden light flickers and dies. Its form turns cold, disappointed.</p>
        <p>"WRONG," it says flatly. "THAT IS THE ANSWER OF SOMEONE WHO HASN'T TRULY REFLECTED ON THEIR CHOICES."</p>
        <p>"TO CLAIM YOU WOULD CHANGE NOTHING IS TO CLAIM YOU LEARNED NOTHING. IT IS TO DENY GROWTH, TO REFUSE WISDOM. YOU JUST TOLD ME OF YOUR DOUBTS AND FEARS, YET NOW YOU CLAIM PERFECT CERTAINTY?"</p>
        <p>The cavern begins to collapse. "YOU WERE SO CLOSE TO UNDERSTANDING. BUT IN THE END, YOU CHOSE COMFORTABLE LIES OVER HONEST REFLECTION."</p>
        <p>Stone falls from above. The ghost watches, disappointed, as the cavern buries you alive.</p>

        <p>True wisdom requires acknowledging our mistakes, not pretending they were all necessary.</p>` %>
