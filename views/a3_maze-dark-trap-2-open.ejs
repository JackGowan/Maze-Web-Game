            The open archway seems humble, unassuming. You walk steadily ready to dodge or roll. 
            <p>But nothing happens.  Beyond is a simple corridor with no traps visible.</p>
            <p>You knew it, you bloody knew it!</p>
            <p>You proceed cautiously, testing each stone before putting your weight on it. Still nothing. The corridor opens into a wider passage.</p>
            <p>Ahead, you see a junction. Three ways forward: a steep staircase going down, a narrow tunnel barely wide enough to crawl through, and a wide corridor that slopes gently upward.</p>
            <p>You hear sounds from different directions: water rushing from below (the stairs), scraping sounds from the tunnel, and distant echoes from the upward corridor.</p>
            <p>Scratched into the stone floor, you find another message:</p>

              One speaks in echoes, empty reigns,<br>
              One whispers secrets, binding chains,<br>
              One roars with truth that never feigns.<br>
              The liar's voice returns your call,<br>

              Trust the voice that cannot stall."
