            You encounter a dwarf crushed by a huge boulder. 
            <p> He must have been caught by a trap. You scan the area but no obvious threats are around you.</p>
            <p> Drawing closer you can see that the dward is still breathing. But he is firmly trapped there is no way you could possibly help him.</p>
            <p> Do you try to wake the dwarf and ask him what he knows about the traps or continue on?</p>
