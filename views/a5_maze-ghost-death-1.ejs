         "I don't have time for this" You state boldly..
        <p>The cavern goes black. Temperature drops fifty degrees. You can't move. Frozen in place.</p>
        <p>Greg's voice becomes terrible, ancient rage given sound: "YOU DARE IGNORE ME? AFTER TEN THOUSAND YEARS OF SOLITUDE, YOU WOULD DENY ME EVEN THE COURTESY OF CONVERSATION?"</p>
        <p> You are unable to respond</p>
        <p>"I ASKED FOR A STORY. SUCH A SMALL THING. BUT YOU SHOWED NO RESPECT, NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF MY PATIENCE AND POWER. SO I WILL TAKE WHAT I NEED."</p>
        <p>The darkness enters your mouth, eyes, ears. Greg consumes your memories, experiences, your very soul - feasting on your essence for entertainment.</p>
        <p style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">YOU HAVE DIED</p>
        <p>Some beings have earned respect through age and power. To ignore them is to invite destruction.</p>
