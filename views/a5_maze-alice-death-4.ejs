        "Stay here. I'll check if the passage is safe."
        <p>Alice's eyes fill with fear. "Please don't leave me alone..." But you're already wading into murky water.</p>
        <p>Water rises to your chest. You push forward, lantern high. Behind you, Alice's voice: "Wait! I hear something—"</p>
        <p>Then her scream. Splashing, snarling, desperate cries for help.</p>
        <p>You try to rush back but the current is strong, the passage too narrow. By the time you reach the junction - only blood on stones and drag marks toward the trapdoor.</p>
        <p>A beast man's laugh echoes above. Without Alice, you're lost. You wander flooded tunnels until exhaustion drags you under.</p>
        <p style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">YOU HAVE DIED</p>
        <p>Never leave your companion vulnerable and alone.</p>
