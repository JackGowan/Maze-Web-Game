        You pull Alice into the tight corner space - her body presses against yours. There is something odd about Alice but you have no time to question.
        <p>The beast man stomps past, sniffing. Its shadow crosses your hiding spot. Alice buries her face against your chest. You hold still.</p>
        <p>The creature grunts and continues. Footsteps fade.</p>
        <p>Alice exhales. "Thank you," she whispers. "I thought it would find us." Relief glistens in her eyes.</p>
        <p>Three exits to the room. One leads to caged corridors - that won't work. Another descends via rough steps. The third - a crawlspace behind a collapsed pillar.</p>
