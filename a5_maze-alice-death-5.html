        You kick the rocks. They clatter loudly in the opposite direction. The beast men jump up, grabbing weapons.
        <p>"Go!" you whisper, pushing Alice toward the side passage.</p>
        <p>But Alice is frozen. She trembles as the beast men's eyes sweep the room. One spots her blonde hair in the firelight.</p>
        <p>"There!" it roars.</p>
        <p>Alice screams and tries to run, but her legs won't cooperate. She stumbles. The beast men are on her in seconds. You fight but there are two, much stronger.</p>
        <p>The last thing you see is Alice's terrified eyes as darkness takes you both.</p>
        <p style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">YOU HAVE DIED</p>
        <p>In danger, stay together. Separated, you are both vulnerable.</p>
